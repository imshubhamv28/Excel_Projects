I'm excited to share my first project in Microsoft Excel! This Excel Sales Dashboard offers an interactive and dynamic way to analyze sales performance. It features pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting to track total sales, individual performance, and target achievements. The dashboardâ€™s dynamic nature allows for real-time updates and filtering through slicers, making it easy to explore different sales dimensions and trends.
